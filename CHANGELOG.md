## v2.0.0 | 9 Apr 2025

### Introducing v2.0.0

`fluxrun` has been updated to version 2.

`fluxrun` is a Python wrapper for EddyPro to calculate EC ecosystem fluxes from raw data files.

This version enhances its usability for a wider range of eddy covariance (EC) sites beyond
the [ETH Grassland Sciences group](https://gl.ethz.ch/).

![](images/fluxrun_gui_v2.0.0.png)

`fluxrun` can be executed using the GUI or directly from the command line interface.

`fluxrun` was created as a wrapper around EddyPro. This means that the flux calculations are done by EddyPro, but
`fluxrun` adds some functionality, e.g.:

- `fluxrun` automatically creates an output folder structure, including run ID.
- The log output from EddyPro (together with other output from `fluxrun`) is stored to a log file.
- There is an additional log file storing warnings and errors.
- `fluxrun` can be executed in parallel, e.g. when calculating fluxes for multiple years `fluxrun` makes it a bit easier
  to run them all at once. Parallelization is not included by default (at the moment), but using the command-line
  interface multiple instances of `fluxrun` can be started quickly. Each started instance gets its own output folder and
  folder structure, including a unique run ID.
- Input files are validated to make sure columns contain numeric data only. Non-numeric data are converted to `-9999`.
- `fluxrun` can create several plots during processing: raw data availability, raw data aggregates and summary plots of
  all variables in EddyPro's `_full_output_` file.
- In case compressed files are used (`.gz`), the files are automatically uncompressed (text format) before processing.
  After processing,in case the uncompressed files are no longer needed, they can be automatically deleted. If the
  files have the file extension `.gz`, they are uncompressed before further processing.

#### Installation

Installation is currently far from perfect, but here we go:

Using [miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#quickstart-install-instructions):

- Create conda environment with required Python version: `conda create -n fluxrun-env python=3.11`
- Activate the created environment: `conda activate fluxrun-env`
- Now check the fluxrun releases [here](https://github.com/holukas/fluxrun/releases) and decide which version to use
- Spot the `.tar.gz` file of the desired fluxrun version and use it to directly install from the GitHub repo via pip:
  `pip install https://github.com/holukas/fluxrun/archive/refs/tags/v2.0.0.tar.gz`
- Now all required dependencies are installed in the environment `fluxrun-env`
- Spot the `.zip` file of the desired fluxrun version and download it from GitHub. Use the same version as for the
  `.tar.gz` file: https://github.com/holukas/fluxrun/archive/refs/tags/v2.0.0.zip
- Unzip the zip file to a folder, e.g. `C:\fluxrun-2.0.0`
- Start GUI: `python C:\fluxrun-2.0.0\fluxrun main.py -g`
- Start processing with CLI: `python C:\fluxrun-2.0.0\fluxrun main.py -f C:\my_project -d 10`. When using the CLI, you
  basically point `fluxrun` to a folder and everything it needs to run it searches in that folder. Therefore, the folder
  `C:\my_project` needs to contain the `.eddypro` and `.metadata` files used by EddyPro, and in addition the file
  `fluxrunsettings.yaml`. The parameter `-d 10` means that only fluxes for the last 10 days are calculted. This
  parameter is useful when running `fluxrun` on an automatic schedule.

#### Description of GUI settings

##### Raw Data Files

- `Select raw data source folder (ASCII)`: Select source folder with eddy covariance (EC) raw data files
- `File name ID`: Define file name ID. The file name needs to contain datetime info, it needs info about the year,
  month, day, hours and minutes. Time info refers to the starting time of the file. Files are handled differently
  depending on the file extension. Files with the ending `.gz` will be umcompressed before processing. Files need to be
  text-based, e.g. CSV files, but they can be compressed as `.gz`. Example: SITE_yyyymmddHHMM.csv.gz
- `Header format`: Numer of header rows in the raw data files.
- `Start`: Define start date for processing, files before this date will be ignored.
- `End`: Define end date for processing, files after this date will be ignored.
- `Plots`:
    - `Availability (raw data)`: Plot data availablility based on the datetime info in the filenames.
    - `Aggregates (raw data)`: Plot aggregates (means) of the raw data.

##### Flux Processing Settings

- `Run flux calculation using EddyPro`: Select for flux calculations.
- `Select EddyPro processing file (*.eddypro)`: Select `.eddypro` settings file that contains the flux processing
  settings for EddyPro. `fluxrun` will search for a `.metadata` file of the same name in the same folder as the
  `.eddypro` file. For example, if the settings file is named `my_settings.eddypro`, then `fluxrun` needs a metadata
  file with the name `my_settings.metadata` in the same folder.

##### Output

- `Select output folder`: Select where to store the results. `fluxrun` automatically creates an output folder structure,
  including run ID for the main folder.
- `Output folder name prefix`: Prefix for the output folder, will be combined with the automatically generated run ID.
- `Plots`:
    - `Summary (flux processing)`: Simple overview plots generated for each variables in the `_full_output_` file from
      the EddyPro output.

##### After Processing

- `Delete uncompressed raw data ASCII after processing`: After processing, `fluxrun` can delete the uncompressed ASCII
  files. The uncompressed files are needed for flux calculations, but unless there is a desire to store the uncompressed
  files they are no longer needed. Only recommended if the input files were compressed (`.gz`).

### Other changes

- Now using PyQt6 for GUI
- Updated code for PyQt6
- Fixed bug in pandas `.pivot()` method, small issue due to the updated pandas version
- `diive` is now using Python version `3.11` upwards
- Updated environment, poetry `pyproject.toml` file now has the currently used structure
- Added key shortcut to start processing ("Ctrl+R")
- Added key shortcut save settings ("Ctrl+S")
- Now always using forward slashes for paths

## v1.4.1 | 27 Mar 2024

- Added new sites `CH-FOR`, `CH-HON` and `CH-TAN` in site selection menu
- Now showing all sites when clicking on site selection drop-down menu
- Added info about default setting in GUI: `Date/Time Format In File Name (default: yyyymmddHHMM)`
- Updated links in sidebar to GitHub locations

## v1.4.0 | 27 Feb 2024

- Added: it is now possible to give a specific file extension in the GUI
  setting `Raw Data: File Settings` > `Date/Time Format In File name`. In case no file extension is given, `fluxrun`
  assumes `.csv` as the default file extension.
    - Example 1: For *uncompressed* files named using a format like `CH-FRU_ec_20230509-0930_withAGC.dat`, the
      respective entry is `ec_yyyymmdd-HHMM_withAGC.dat`. The site name `CH-FRU_` is added automatically during
      processing and must not be added in this setting.
    - Example 2: For *uncompressed* files named using a format like `CH-FRU_202305090930.csv`, the respective
      entry is `yyyymmddHHMM` (same as in earlier version). The site name `CH-FRU_` is added automatically during
      processing and must not be added in this setting. The file extension `.csv` is assumed since no specific file
      extension is given.
    - Example 3: For *compressed* files named using a format like `CH-FRU_ec_20230509-0930_withAGC.dat.gz`, the
      respective entry is `ec_yyyymmdd-HHMM_withAGC.dat`. The suffix `.gz` is automatically added to the given file
      extension.
    - Example 4: For *compressed* files named using a format like `CH-FRU_202305090930.csv.gz`, the respective
      entry is `yyyymmddHHMM` (same as in earlier version).
- Added: During unzipping of gzip files, the logger now also displays the name of the file before unzipping
  is started. This way it is easier to identify files for which unzipping does not work, e.g., due to
  corrupted binary files (irregular structure). (`fluxrun.ops.file.uncompress_gzip`)

## v1.3.2 | 21 Oct 2023

- Moved repo to GitLab: https://github.com/holukas/fluxrun

## v1.3.1 - 1 Jul 2023

- Updated poetry.lock file
- Updated version number, was wrong in last release, should have been v1.3.0 in toml

## v1.3.0 - 2 Apr 2023

- New setting in `Output` > `After Processing` > `Delete uncompressed raw data ASCII`:
  if selected, the uncompressed raw data files (ASCII) are deleted after finished flux
  calculations. The *compressed* raw data ASCII files are not affected by this setting.
  Background: for EddyPro flux calculations, the zipped files are uncompressed to regular
  ASCII files. These uncompressed files are not required for long-term storage because they
  take up a lot of disk space. For storage, we keep the zipped (compressed) ASCII files.

## v1.2.0 - 20 Mar 2023

- Now using `poetry` as dependency manager
- Removed `setup.py`, not needed with `poetry`
- Removed `environment.yml`, not needed with `poetry`
- Removed `start_fluxrun.py`, GUI is now started with CLI `-g` flag

## v1.1.1 - 18 Dec 2022

- Fixed bug where calculations from previously uncompressed `.csv.gz` files would not
  work. `fluxrun` tried to write an informal `readme.txt` to the output folder of the
  current run, but the folder did not yet exist. Output folders are now created before
  the EddyPro raw data folder is set in `fluxrun.FluxRunEngine.update_settings`.
    - `make_outdirs(settings_dict=self.settings_dict)` now comes first
    - `self.set_dir_eddypro_rawdata()` now comes second

## v1.1 - 4 Nov 2022

- Refactored code
- Functionality is now separated into `FluxRunGUI` for the graphical user interface,
  and `FluxRunEngine` for calculations. This is needed to execute the script without
  the GUI via CLI.
- Started to implement script execution via CLI: `-g` as arg starts the `fluxrun` GUI
- Added CLI args to start script without GUI
- Derived settings, .i.e., setttings that are constructed from parameters given
  in the GUI, are now reset when the app starts
- Updated all packages in conda env to latest compatible versions

  data that is then used for flux calculations.
- changed: folder structure is now sequential to produced output
- changed: if 'ASCII File Compression' is set to 'None', then the raw data  
  files will be directly used from the provided source folder, i.e. in this  
  case the raw data files are not copied to the local run folder
- GUI: changed location of 'ASCII File Compression'

## v0.2.0 - 17 Feb 2021
